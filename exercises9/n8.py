# Vector Dot Product Question: Write a program that takes two 2D vectors (x and y components)
# as input and calculates their dot product. Solution:

x1 = int(input("x coordinate of first vector: "))
x2 = int(input("x coordinate of second vector: "))
y1 = int(input("y coordinate of first vector: "))
y2 = int(input("y coordinate of second vector: "))

dotProduct = x1*x2 + y1*y2
print(dotProduct)
